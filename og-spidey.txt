O.G. Spiderman is of course awesome, total science nerd, super strong, shoots webs, climbs walls, what's not to like!?

I've played through both of the new spiderman games to 100% completion, and I feel no shame in that. 

Unluckily for O.G. Spiderman, I typically used the Scarlet Spider, Spiderman 2099, and Ben-Reily Scarlet Spider costumes when playing.
