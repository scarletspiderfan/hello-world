 I'm also a long-time Batman nerd. I traded comic books with the neighborhood kids and got my hands on some goodies, including bits from the 'Death in the Damily' arc, and the 'Knightfall' arc. 
 Death in the Family came about as the result of a poll that DC comics conducted asking if Batman should return to being a solo character, and when readers voted yes, they decided to reward them by brutally killing robin in a horrifying manner that left my young self scarred for life. 
 Knightfall was a major inspiration for the final installation of the Christopher Nolan trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises. Not only did the arc introduce Bane, but also specifically went through Bane breaking Batmans spine and Batmans eventual recovery.
