Big fan of 'The Long Halloween' which is a Batman story taking place over the course of a year or so, involving the murders of many prominent criminals in Gotham. It's very noir-esque and doesn't grant Batman super-human detective powers like some other ones do.

One of the first graphic novels I ever read was 'Kingdom Come' and it is an absolute work of art, the paintings are amazing throughout the book and the story is absolutely fantastic. It asks the question of what happens when a new generation of super heroes takes over?
